2:      George and Abe,
2:      It's been a while since we've all spoken.  I hope you guys have fared as
2:      well as possible through these trying times.
2:      I wanted to reach out with a pretty sizable update.  Johnny and I have

2:      We'd love to show it to you and get your feedback then potentially get it
2:      into your hands if you're interested.  Would you be available for a demo in
2:      the coming weeks?
2:      Thanks,
